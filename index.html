        <div id="about">
            <p>Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (BJJ), historically derived from ground fighting techniques in Judo, is a martial art and popular competition sport more similar to Grecco-roman wrestling than striking martial arts.  Students can exert themselves physically at 100% which not only makes it excellent exercise and strength training but also conditions them to be level-headed if an attacker is trying to overwhelm them. The techniques are designed for smaller and weaker people to defend themselves against bigger and stronger assailants. It is also popular in mixed martial arts.</p>

                <h3>Classes</h3>
                <p>Our classes are held 4 days out of the week (refer to the schedule for details). Because we operate as a club, we try to work around the group&#39;s varying schedules and life commitments.  We have college students with final exams and parents with kids, so our <a href="#schedule">schedule</a> can change, but the classes are all in the evening. The club is for adult men and women and currently the student ages range from early 20s to 50s. We share the facility with Tallahassee Judo which offers popular classes for adults and kids (see schedule).</p>
                <h3>Railroad Square</h3>
                <p>As the name would suggest, we are located in Railroad Square Art Park at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/641+McDonnell+Dr,+Tallahassee,+FL+32310/@30.4325372,-84.2942536,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88ecf5135c0752f5:0xebbed400a2e774f7!8m2!3d30.4325372!4d-84.2920649">641-B McDonnell Dr.</a> in Tallahassee, Florida. The facility is conveniently located adjacent to FAMU campus and just south of FSU campus and &ldquo;College Town,&rdquo; making this ideal for students at either college.</p>
